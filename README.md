## Getting started

- Install [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org)
- Clone this repository
- `cd prices`
- `npm install` to install the application's dependencies
- `npm start` to start the application

## Going further

Here are some ideas on how it can be improved using other Electron APIs.

- Double-click commodity to open directly on https://stooq.com
- Refresh automatically on an interval.
- Add the price of platinum (`PL=F`) to the app.
- Export prices to a `.csv` file.
- Show percentage change in price.
- Show notifications when prices go above/below certain amounts.
